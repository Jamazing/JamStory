		 * In this implementation, I've implemented the concept, that the player object will dispatch an
		 * "attempt collide" event, which will be caught by the world, which will dispatch an event, telling
		 * the player object about what has been hit, *if* something has been hit.
		 * This is to have something working. I am willing to approach the original idea if required, but I will need
		 * a more detailed explanation.

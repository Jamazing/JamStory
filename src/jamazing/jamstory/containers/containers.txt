Containers Package
(containers)

This package is designed for grouping the different sections of the display easily.
Inside, are the child display objects it controlls.

Currently there are three types (no inheritance) of container:
	World Container
	Background Container
	Overlay Container
	
The World contains the main display, designed to be moved left and right with the player at the center
	It will be changing ever frame and has bounds between the level start and end
	Contains the level objects and Player
	Likely to need re-worked in newer versions
	
The Background contains the flat background, and any little interesting background things.
	It will rarely change
	
The Overlay is the ui overlay that is the same throughout the game
	Things like a timer, score, jam left, level name etc will all be stored here
	Anything that pops up over the game - splash screens etc should also be handled by this

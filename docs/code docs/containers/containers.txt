Containers Package
(containers)

This package is designed for grouping the different sections of the display easily.
Inside, are the child display objects it controlls.

Currently there are three types (no inheritance) of container:
	World Container
	Background Container
	Overlay Container
	
The World contains the main display, designed to be moved left and right with the player at the center
	Contains the player and all "main game" options
		These are loaded in from level files during initialisation
	The co-ordinates for the reference point, are at the bottom left (0,0)
	Heights in the level.xml file are loaded as heights from the ground, so no negatives are needed.
	
The Background contains the flat background, and any little interesting background things.
	A static background that will rarely change.
		Currently has no real functionality, other than ensuring the background is at the back of the scene
	
The Overlay is the ui overlay that is the same throughout the game
	Things like a timer, score, jam left, level name etc will all be stored here
	Anything that pops up over the game - splash screens etc should also be handled by this

World Class
(containers package - jamazing.jamstory.containers)

Purpose:
	The world class is in charge of the various main-game objects; such as the platforms and the player.
	It handles the main screen movements and loading of the level files
	
Listeners:
	onLoadXml
		Loads the level xml file; turning the data within into in-game objects.
		In future this should be changed to a level-loader object at startup - that sends the data to the world to initialise it.
			This should be changed soon to read a player-start point
			Which would allow easy changes in level design.
		Currently this can handle static platform objects
			Heights are relative to the ground (100 = 100 from the ground, not 100 below)
				(for easier work on our producer)
			Reference points for each platform are in the center

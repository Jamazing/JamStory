JAMAZING GIT
IF YOU CAN READ THIS, YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SYNCED.

It is very important; that you let people know which issue and files you are working on.
Please sync the repo everytime you log in or want to write code.
Please push instantly, when you have created a new file; before writing in it.
Push changes you make regularly, they are there to preserve your code - it's an ongoing backup.
Any code that is not on the git, effectively does not exist. DO NOT write a day of code before pushing.

Thanks,
I will write how to properly use this git and such like, and how we will implement file locking properly
soon.
